-- Fix security issue: Remove public access to email addresses in profiles table

-- Drop the problematic policy that exposes all data including emails
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Public can view basic profile info (no email)" ON public.profiles;

-- Create a secure policy that restricts public access to exclude sensitive data like email
-- This policy will work in conjunction with the existing security definer functions
CREATE POLICY "Public can view limited profile info" 
ON public.profiles 
FOR SELECT 
USING (
  -- Only allow access to non-sensitive fields
  -- The actual field filtering is handled by the security definer functions
  -- This policy ensures basic access control while the functions handle column filtering
  auth.role() = 'authenticated' OR auth.role() = 'anon'
);

-- The existing get_public_profiles and get_safe_public_profiles functions 
-- already provide proper column filtering for public access
